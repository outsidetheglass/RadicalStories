<h1>Languages Used</h1>
<p>
    This website is an example for showcasing my skills. I used C#, AngularJS, AJAX (both internal and external), Javascript/Typescript, CSS3, HTML5, Bootstrap, Linq, the Entity framework, SQL Database, and ASP.NET Web API. Also Mandarin Chinese.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br />
    My name is Stephanie (Stevie) Taylor, and I'm a junior web developer looking to find a job working with the .NET framework. I am willing to relocate anywhere at my own expense. Please contact me via my email, outsidetheglass93@gmail.com, or via my LinkedIn account at the following link: <br/> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevie-stephanie-taylor-229a2954?trk=hp-identity-name">Stevie's LinkedIn Account</a>.

    <h3>What is a radical</h3>
    <br />
     Chinese radicals are comparable to English letters. They're written in a very specific stroke order; if they're not drawn in that stroke order, it's done wrong. So listing by the number of strokes it takes to draw a character or radical like I've done here is a common organization. In the Categories tab you'll find a listing of Chinese radicals by the number of strokes it takes to draw the radical.

    <h4>Coming Eventually</h4>
    <br />
    I hope that by working through the logic of my drawing radicals program I'll be able to extend it to someday be able to take in coordinates from a picture, and be able to reverse engineer which radicals (and therefore which Chinese character) it is. I have been unable to find a resource that can deduce what a character is from a picture. The closest is a feature of an app called Pleco, but it is often inaccurate. I'm studying algorithms so that I can write a program that uses coordinates and answers I give it to better create an algorithm that will be able to do so. To be honest, even if I found a program that existed and worked that did the same thing I would still work on this pet project. I do things to learn more and to become better at whatever it is I'm working on; it's the sort of worker I am. I love improving and learning almost more than anything else!
